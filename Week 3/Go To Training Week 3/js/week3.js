// you can do var fruitBowl = newArray or you can simplify it by making the variable equal to the array from the start like above.

var fruitBowl = ["peach", "pear","apple","banana"];
//console.log(fruitBowl); .......console log will return the number of items in array and list.
//to change an item in the array, use index number to be changed and name new space:

fruitBowl[0] = "pear"
console.log(fruitBowl);
